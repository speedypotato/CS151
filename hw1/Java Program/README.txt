Welcome to the README.txt

The system will prompt you to enter a character depending on your desired operation.
p = add passenger
g = add group
c = cancel reservation
a = print available seats
m = print reserved seats
q = quit

Simply follow the prompts afterward for each option.

Things to note:
- Service class needs to be fully typed out.  e.g. "first" or "Economy".
- Seat preference is simply a character input
	- w = window seat
	- a = aisle seat
	- c = center seat
- Passenger and group names are cAsE sEnSiTiVe.
- The system cannot effectively handle duplicate names.
- When entering a list of names it is safer if there are no spaces between the names.  e.g. "Me,Myself,I"
- The system will default to "data.txt" if you do not feed it a filename when running the program.
- Input direction should be working because I tested it myself
- Why is the 1st homework my largest program to date?
